  	      This is what it was like playing HS tennis for Plainfield in the 90s. We were always hype to play Irvington &amp; the Newark schools.<br><br>We'd encourage them &amp; try to get them to come play w/us in the summers. Mr. Van Blake was a visionary. <a href="https://twitter.com/NifMuhammad/status/1644203088540999681">https://twitter.com/NifMuhammad/status/1644203088540999681</a>

  	      Plus all the kids like us on Scotch Plains, South Plfd &amp; private schools all played for Plainfield preferred to play with us in the summer. Our summer travel team from 94-97 was ridiculous. That team would've won a state title easily had we been able to play together in HS.

  	      I'm always going to be amazed I had the good fortunate of being raised in the one city in New Jersey where a black WWII veteran retired in his 50s, fell in love with tennis &amp; decided kids in his hometown needed to play it &amp; devoted the last 40+ yrs of his life to that cause.
