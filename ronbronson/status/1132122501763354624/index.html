  	      Also this tweet has *no* audience but I've been wanting to tell somebody for weeks that skeeball throws are kinda like baseball pitches. Like curves, sinkers, and various grips. (I know, I know..you all just wanna talk about feral pigs.)

  	      Old school 1950s lanes didn't have ðŸ’¯cups so you max out at 450 and the lanes are longer than modern ones too. <br><br>I haven't thrown a perfect game on an older model yet, but I'll take this 350. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1564085962002800641-FbS_4zhUIAAY8Pj.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1564085962002800641-FbS_4zhUIAAY8Pj.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
