  	      Coming off a state title in 2022 and losing most of our stars, it was going to be a transition year. <br><br>We were fortunate to have 9th graders step up, as well as returners who leveled up, along our senior glue players led us to our 4th straight conference title too.

  	      On the whole awards thing, nobody coaches for the accolades or the pay, it's about growth. I didn't think I'd do it beyond the first year, it's just a fun diversion. But then you start to know the players &amp; it's fun year-to-year to see how they evolve and gain confidence.

  	      All I can think about, is that my own HS coach would be so positively amused by all of this. Like there's no way he's not somewhere listening to jazz and telling me  "job well done, Ronnie." Still the only person on Earth whose has ever called me that.

  	      The doubles "curse" as I began calling it, was a 27-year drought since the only time the girls program had ever had an individual state doubles champion. 3 other times they'd had seeded doubles teams at state and all lost; once in the Final, but the other two were upset earlier.

  	      As a HS tennis coach, you don't get many opportunities to "coach the big game" because there are usually several matches going on at once. <br><br>So coaching the last match of the state tournament, that went 3-sets was as close to "Game 7" vibes as I get. It was pretty fun.
