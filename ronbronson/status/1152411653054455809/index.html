  	      Seeing Deerhunter + Dirty Projectors tonight. (31st show I've seen since moving to PDX) Apparently I've listened to each an equal number of times (according to my <a href="http://last.fm">http://last.fm</a>)

  	      Speaking of <a href="http://last.fm">http://last.fm</a>, apparently I've seen all but 4 of my Top 20 artists in-person. Really need to see Lower Dens on their next tour, one of those bands I went from listening to one record to deciding "this is on the soundtrack of my life" over the past few years. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1152411658397990912-D_4wSzNUEAAr6rr.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1152411658397990912-D_4wSzNUEAAr6rr.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
