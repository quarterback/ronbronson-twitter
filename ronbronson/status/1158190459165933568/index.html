  	      I'm just going to talk about designing better closure experiences and off-boarding in digital products.

  	      Maybe a year late, since I went on a whole "Hostile Design" tangent the past year. But I have a real stick in my craw about the abuse and disrespect that most closure experiences contain. It's obviously not just digital - IRL experiences are poorly designed for offboarding.

  	      Slowly disengaging from the Twitterverse, tbh. So many real things happening, and it's a bit unsatisfying on the whole. Also looking at the remnants of my (dead) Tumblr yesterday made me start thinking about the afterlife of my "content" here. And what comes next for my ideas.
