  	      RIP Mr. Collins. He could play almost any instrument, but he shined on flute and sax &amp; would sometimes impromptu solo at our jazz band concerts. The parents liked it too.<br><br>(These days, folks might complain that he was stealing 'our' moment, but we *loved* when he'd play w/us.)

  	      I also feel this way whenever I share a song with someone and they don't recognize the greatness from the outset. Pushing my phone doesn't have the same dramatic flare as pulling the needle off a record, though.
