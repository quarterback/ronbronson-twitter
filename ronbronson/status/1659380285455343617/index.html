  	      Love the coverage of Plainfield HS tennis. Just a minor quibble: Plainfield's peak was in the 90s; 91 boys team was 17-3; Group 4 sectional semis. 97 team was 17-7; won a share of Watchung Conference. Girls did same in 1999-00. <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisNalwasky/status/1659195277264445440">https://twitter.com/ChrisNalwasky/status/1659195277264445440</a>

  	      Plainfield not winning a state title was purely because so many kids in the 90s played at private area schools. At one point in 96-97, there were around 25-30 varsity tennis players from Plainfield playing at the same time. It was nuts.

  	      Also our 1996 summer town tennis team got all of those kids together and we went undefeated; yes we even beat Westfield that summer. Those of us alums who remember still talk about how epic that squad was.
