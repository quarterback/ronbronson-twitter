  	      Less a rant &amp; more a story. An elderly gentleman who only spoke Haitian creole came up to me tonight asking for help. (I only speak some Spanish &amp; can read some ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® not useful) <br><br>He had several edge cases: 1) couldn't speak English well 2) needed a wheelchair 3) no phone w/him

  	      I basically spent the last 90 minutes of my delay trying to help him with his - we called &amp; updated w/his son a bunch. CX was swamped. There were a cascading series of escalations that needed human intervention.

  	      But there was no way to flag this anywhere. And relying on the kindness of overworked humans clearly wasn't getting us far - which is why he asked a literal stranger for help. He'd exhausted all routes.

  	      If he had his phone it's have helped but this feels like the sort of issue that simply would've been easily solved in 1999 that is a giant disaster in 2021.
